      <p>The week has been pretty rich on the chatbot scene. My 3 picks are the new ChatGPT's plugin, Claude 2 from
        Anthropic and Bard landing in Europe.</p>
      <h3 id="openais-new-plugin-code-interpretera-data-analyst-in-your-pocket">OpenAI's new plugin "Code interpreter" - a
        data analyst in your pocket</h3>
      <p>OpenAI rolled-out a new plugin for ChatGPT Plus users: Code interpreter. It allows users to run Python code in a
        sandboxed environment that can under command do a series of complex tasks: Data analysis, Image processing or Code
        editing.</p>

      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>ChatGPT has released a new plugin called Code Interpreter, which allows users to run Python code in a sandboxed
          environment.</li>
        <li>The Code Interpreter can be used for a variety of tasks such as data analysis, image processing, code editing,
          and other tasks like generating text, translating languages, and writing creative content.</li>
        <li>The plugin can be enabled from the settings under Beta Features, and it can be used to upload and analyze files,
          including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and SQL databases.</li>
        <li>The author used the plugin to perform deep data analysis on a .csv file of Customer Lifetime Value, generating
          various visualizations and insights.</li>
        <li>The Code Interpreter can also be used to create presentations, perform calculations, and generate various types
          of visual charts.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the meantime, Anthropic - a competitor of OpenAI founded by former employees - deployed its new chatbot: Claude
        2. Having read different post comparing it to ChatGPT, it seems to do an excellent job when extracting data from
        document and has been trained on data up to early 2023. To be continued..</p>

      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
      <p>Anthropic, an AI startup co-founded by ex-OpenAI executives, has released Claude 2, a new text-generating AI model
        available in beta in the U.S. and U.K.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Claude 2 is an improvement over its predecessor, Claude 1.3, scoring higher on tests such as the bar exam, the
          U.S. Medical Licensing Exam, and Python coding tests.</li>
        <li>The new model was trained on more recent data and has improved reasoning and self-awareness, but it still shares
          the same architecture as Claude 1.3.</li>
        <li>Despite improvements, Claude 2 still has limitations such as hallucination, generating toxic text, and data
          regurgitation, but Anthropic claims it is "2x better" at giving harmless responses.</li>
        <li>Anthropic has raised $1.45 billion to date and estimates it will need $5 billion over the next two years to
          create its envisioned chatbot, with most of the cash going towards compute infrastructure.</li>
